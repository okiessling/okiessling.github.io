One of the first "projects" I ever did was doing a powertrain swap on the low-cost Hobbyzone Super Cub LP RC Float plane to allow me to stick a GoPro to the underside to capture some footage.

For the keen observers out there, you will hear what they call "full engine failure" around the 0:35 mark as one of the BLDC motor wires wiggled loose. Thank goodness for glide ratios (and no passengers onboard)!


The motor mounting as seen in the first photo is a miracle of Engineering as it was held in place by being press-fit into the soft EPS fuselage and two wires looping around the motor's bolt holes. It is no wonder why I got so enthralled with 3D printing soon after....
