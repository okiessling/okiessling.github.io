Fourth year product design course resulted in the creation of this unique 3 in 1 center finding multitool. Allows the user to:  

1. Center-find the end of round stock (up to 140mm or 5.5 inches in diameter) or square stock (up to 200mm or 7.5 inches in length).
2. Center-find the middle of a board or rectangular stock (up to 100mm in width).
3. Trace lines at any distance from the edge along a board or rectangular stock (up to 300mm in width).

## Overview

Many center-finding tools exist but not one with as much functionality as this. The most exciting feature is the two small pegs that allow you to trace lines at the center of a board. The center point between the begs is the location where you place the pencil so you simply need to rotate the pegs until they contact the workpiece and voila - you have found the center. 

The current method of holding the ruler is only possible with 3D Printing as it bridges an air gap to create a small slot for the ruler to mate with a transition fit. In the future, it would be best to injection mold such a product which would require a small pan-head screw and a heat set insert to clamp the ruler in place.
