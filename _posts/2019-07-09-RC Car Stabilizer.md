Fun mini-project to hack together an RC car with the gimabl from a FB marketplace DJI Phantom 2 drone to get stabilized videos of highspeed passes. 

## Summary
- **COST**:  $100 CAD
- **TIME TO COMPLETE**: 5 days

## Overview

High amps, speed and sensitive gimbal equipment - what could go wrong! To call this project more than a "hack" would be generous but was really rewarding to see the final footage.

Electronics were simple as the gimbal interfaced directly with the DJI Phantom 2 control board which transmitted footage to standalone monitor through a Fat Shark ImmersionRC 5.8GHz transmitter.

I took rough dimensions of the RC car and then 3D printed some arms to mount the gimbal plate and a small box to protect the electronics from debris. The LiPo battery to power the gimbal was velcroed to the top of the box which I admit isn't my smartest design choice.

Below is a high-speed run of the system in action. You can really see the stabilization in effect near the end of the run as we go over 65 km/h and the tires start to ballon and the car hits some potholes. The project ultimately came to an end a few runs later when the new higher center of gravity caused it to flip during turning. Thankfully the 3D printed arms cracked and absorbed some of the impact leaving the gimbal banged up but functional.
