# Introduction
> Tools are like the pathway from my brain to the real world - [*Stuff Made Here*](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere){:target="_blank"}

Probably the best description of the Mechanical Engineers conundrum is that you move through life wanting just   
"$$ n + 1 $$" tools where "$$ n $$" is the current number of tools you own.

This was no different for me in late 2020 as it had been about 1.5 years since I had been completly enthralled by my first 3D printer purchase (Tevo Tornado). I had been on a non-stop printing rampage downloading and designing trickets to my hearts content. Soon however, we hit the limitation of that technology as 3D printing is the number one choice for manufacturing as long as you don't need high strength or large size due the ability to simply start a print and wait for it to finish.

I had always wanted to start working with one of the GOAT materials : *Aluminum* due to its high strength/weight ratio, oxidation resistance and low cost. Most Universities have machine shops you can access, however this was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic which ruled that option out. This left no option but to begin work on the best, low cost CNC machine I could design to enlighten me from the world of polymers to metals.
