During my 2.5 years at McMaster Formula Electric (MACE), I had the pleasure of being a part of the chassis team for one year before becoming the Engineering Manager of the chassis/ergonomics team for the remaining time.


## Driver Profile Test Assembly & CF Seat

_The red template is "Percy" and is described in the FSAE rule book for critical driver dimensions_


This test assembly was used to determine key angles and positions of items in the monocoque to best get an average of what our two drivers preferred. Designing to the average is generally a poor idea as no one in the world will fit that average. However, due to the limited adjustment possibilites of certain inputs (such as steering wheel angle and height) was still a valuable tool. Much of the important angles and distances we measured came with reference to the NASA Handbook: [Human Integration Design](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/human-integration-design-handbook/){:target="_blank"}


The carbon-fiber seat shown above was the next item to be designed as it took these approximate dimensions from the test assembly mentioned above and incorporated them. A lot of time was spent tweaking the flanged edges to allow enough room and easy placement of driver inserts during events. Driver inserts were made using a 2-part Urethane foam mix similar to what is used in NASCAR and F1. Final adjustments for comfort could be made with Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) foam similar to the material used in foam gym floor tiles. It can be heat set with a hair dryer to get exact shapes.


## Ergonomic Steering Wheel Grips

Additionally, the team prototyped different ergonomic grips to be used on the steering wheel for driver comfort and to prevent slipping. Unique grips could be made and easily swapped for each driver while still allowing easy access to dials and switches on the wheel. These grips could be 3D printed from PETG.
